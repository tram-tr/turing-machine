# Turing Machine 
The program will ask the user to enter the file name of the Turing Machine. After reading the Turing Machine, it will continuously ask the user to input the string and the maximum steps (or maximum transition). Every time the program reads in an input string and a max step, it will print the output to the screen.\
The program will terminate when the input string is “endinput”. The program will then
record all the computed strings and their outputs in the text file with the name
[name of machine]-output.txt
